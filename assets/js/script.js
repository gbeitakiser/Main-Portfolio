var bioPageInfo1 = "Hey there! My name is Gabriel. I was born in Oakland, California but moved to San Jose, " + 
"Costa Rica when I was three. After attending kindergarten there, I moved to Tucson, Arizona when I was 5 and stayed there through college. " + 
"I studied sustainable architecture and city planning at the University of Arizona and graduated with a B.S. in " +
"Sustainable Built Environments."

var bioPageInfo2 = "After graduating and interning with Tucson's Office of Integrated Planning, I realized that I love to write and grew impatient with the bureaucracy " +
"of city government. I took a 180-degree turn and found a job as an automobile journalist in San Francisco, where I currently reside. " +
"I test cars and write about them for a living, but I have an unquenchable thirst for learning " +
"and an outright obsession with technology and the many ways it shapes our world. That thirst led me to attend this coding bootcamp " +
"where I aim to learn how to interact with computers on a deeper level."

var bioPageInfo3 = "Let me be clear, my focus isnâ€™t just technology but on how to change the underlying systems that govern our society and dictate " +
"the direction of our species. I see a great need to adapt and evolve these systems to help us confront the problems we face as a society. " +
"Technology is an ally and a powerful tool that can help us solve problems like climate change and wealth inequality. " +
"I want to learn the language of computers so that I can advance these causes."
